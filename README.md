# Quantum
Here there are some codes that simulate quantum systems and some codes that implement algorithms to be performed on real IBM quantum devices.
  
  # Quantum Error Correction
Here are presented the codes that implement the quantum error correction algorithms for three qubits. They can be run on the quantum computer ibmq_manila available on the IBM clous, from IBM Quantum Lab. The programms are written in Python using the module Qiskit, which is designed to interface with the IBM quantum computers.
