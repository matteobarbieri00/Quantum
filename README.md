# Quantum
Here there are some codes that simulate quantum systems and some codes that implement algorithms to be performed on real IBM quantum devices.
  
  # Quantum Error Correction
  Files: BitFlip_QEC_3qubits.py, PhaseFlip_QEC_3qubits.py
  
  Here are presented the codes that implement the quantum error correction algorithms for three qubits. They can be run on the quantum computer ibmq_manila available on the IBM cloud, from IBM Quantum Lab. The programms are written in Python using the module Qiskit, which is designed to interface with the IBM  quantum computers.
  
  # Encoding Prcedure
  Files: encoding_wcf.py
  
  This ios a symulation coded in Python that confronts the fidelity betwwen the initial and final state when a qubit is not encoded and when a qubit is   encoded, showing how the encoding procedure increases the fidelity and how is worth it to perform it before a quantum error correction protocol when the error probability on a qubit is p < 0.5
